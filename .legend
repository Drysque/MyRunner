a '=' will summon a laser that charges and shoots after a period of time.
a 'x' will summon a electrical field that doesn't move.
a '-' will summon a homing missile. It will target the player no matter where you place it.
A blank space is used to separate obstacles.
A \ is ignored. Use is to cancel the auto-deletion of trailing spaces at the end of lines.

Obstacles spawn depending on where you placed them on the map.
Any collision with these obstacles will lead to death.
The game is considered finished when the game reaches the end of a line.

If the file contains any other character, the map is considered invalid and the game won't launch.
If the file has more or less than 4 lines, the map is considered invalid and the game won't launch.
If the lines are of different length, the map is valid but the game will ignore any obstacles past the length of the shortest line.

If you have trouble getting the length of each lines to match because of trailing spaces being deleted when a file is saved, you can use a '\' at the end of the lines.

launch with -e for examples, or use the maps/ folder.
